## üí¨ Background

**About the compnay**

Cyclistic, launched in 2016, operates a bike-share program with 5,824 geotracked bicycles and 692 stations across Chicago. Its flexible pricing plans include single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, catering to a broad audience. Casual riders use single-ride or full-day passes, while annual memberships are purchased by Cyclistic members.

Financial analysis reveals that annual members are more profitable than casual riders. To drive growth, Cyclistic aims to increase annual memberships by converting casual riders, who are already familiar with the service, into loyal members. This approach focuses on maximizing existing customer relationships rather than attracting entirely new ones.

To achieve this, Cyclistic plans to analyze historical bike trip data to understand the differences between casual riders and members. Insights will guide the design of targeted marketing strategies, focusing on what motivates casual riders to commit to memberships and how digital media can enhance these efforts.
